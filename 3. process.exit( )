How to exit process in Node.js ?

1. Using process.exit() Function: 
This function tells Node.js to end the process which is running at the same time with an exit code. 
By calling this function Node.js will force the current process thatâ€™s running to exit as soon as possible.

2. Using ctrl+C key: 
When running a program of NodeJS in the console, you can close it with ctrl+C directly from the console.
